            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been thinking about numbers for most of my life. It wasn't until I helped my oldest child learn to count to 20 that I thought that the way we count in the English language is silly. There is no logic in our base-10 counting system until we get to 17: "fif teen" (what's a "fif?") is followed by "six teen" (ah, six is a number I recognize!) which is followed by "seven teen" (aha! seven is another number I recognize!). And this got me thinking that surely there's a better way to count.</p>

<p>Soon thereafter, I started finding a better way to count in a chapter of Malcolm Gladwell's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017930/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0316017930&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=erpo0f-20&amp;linkId=AZHPZTBIYAL52CGL">Outliers</a>. Gladwell posits that <a href="http://gladwell.com/outliers/rice-paddies-and-math-tests/">Chinese-speaking kids can memorize multi-digit numbers much faster than English-speaking kids can</a> since the sequence "4, 8, 5, 3, 9, 7, 6" is made up of monosyllabic words in Chinese and "7" has 2 syllables in English. I would add that since Chinese is a tonal language, this sequence also has its own tune. Quick show of hands, who knows the 7-digit phone number from the Tommy Tutone hit, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTdTwcmxyo">Jenny</a>" from 1981? Do you know that number because you can sing the number or because you can recite the number?</p>

<p>In the same chapter, Gladwell suggests that adding numbers in Chinese is easier than in English because the names of the numbers are more logical in Chinese than in English. For instance, the number 25 is "twenty-five" in English and the equivalent to "two ten five" in Chinese. Aha! Then 11 is "ten 1" in Chinese and 123 is "hundred two-ten three" in Chinese. In English (and <lang = "es">En español</lang> ), the numbers between 11 and 15 are hard to memorize. In Chinese, pshh: "ten one," "ten two," "ten three," "ten four," "ten five."</p>

<p>This made me think that perhaps learning numbers would be easier if we came up with different units. If we were to count "0 - 10" in the standard English manner, then "11 - 19" would be known as "ten one," "ten two," "ten three," &amp; etc. "20 - 29" would be "two-ten," "two-ten one," "two-ten two," "two-ten three," &amp; etc.</p>

<p>Already, "1200" can be read two different ways in English, "One thousand two hundred" and "Twelve hundred.". It wouldn't be too large of a stretch for "1000" to no longer be known as "one thousand" but to be known as "ten hundred." Instead, "10000" would be known as "one thousand." Since the place names are changed in an exponential-growth pattern, this probably should be written as "1,0000" (10^4 or 100 hundreds) instead of "10,000." I could then call 1,0000,0000 "1 million" (10^8 or 1 thousand thousands) instead of "100 million," and 1,0000,0000,0000,0000 (10^16 or 1 million millions) "1 billion" instead of "10 quintillion."</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
    <th>Place</th>
    <th>10^0</th>
    <th>10^1</th>
    <th>10^2</th>
    <th>10^4</th>
    <th>10^8</th>
    <th>10^16</th>
    <th>10^32</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Place Name</th>
    <td>Ones</td>
    <td>Tens</td>
    <td>Hundreds</td>
    <td>Thousands</td>
    <td>Millions</td>
    <td>Billions</td>
    <td>Trillions</td>

</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Smallest Example</th>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>100</td>
    <td>1,0000</td>
    <td>1,0000,<wbr>0000</td>
    <td>1,0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000</td>
    <td>1,0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In my numbering system, I might also shorten two names: "seven" becomes "sep" and "tens" become "-ty"(pronounced like "tea")." 10 - 20 would be read as:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
    <th>Number</th>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>11</td>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>13</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>17</td>
    <td>18</td>
    <td>19</td>
    <td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <td>Onety</td>
    <td>Onety-one</td>
    <td>Onety-two</td>
    <td>Onety-three</td>
    <td>Onety-four</td>
    <td>Onety-five</td>
    <td>Onety-six</td>
    <td>Onety-sep</td>
    <td>Onety-eight</td>
    <td>Onety-nine</td>
    <td>Twoty</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Already there's some logic to the number names. The place names would be recursive like so:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
    <th>Number</th>
    <th>English Name</th>
    <th>New Name</th>

<p>While thinking of this numbering system, I found out that one of my programming heroes, Donald Knuth, had come up with a very similar alternative almost 30 years prior (1981 - same year as Tommy Tutone's number-memorization hit mentioned above -- coincidence?). His system is called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-yllion">-yllion</a>" and is also influenced by the Chinese number system, has exponential binary growth, grouping digits in fours, renames some of the numbers, and has recursive naming. Knuth gets rid of "thousand" and replaces it with "myriad;" "million," "billion," etc become "myllion," "byllion," etc. I thought it would be great to use a combination of the two, especially for insanely large numbers.</p>

<p>While driving or working, I would count things in this manner until it became second-nature to me. Then I realized that knowing a secret language that has a global speaker count of 1 is not a good thing. I could either spread my idea by conquering and burning the world ala Genghis Khan or I could quietly give up. I chose the more gentle option.</p>

<h3 id="the-chinese-connection">The Chinese Connection</h3>

<p>Fast forward to a few nights ago. I was studying the Chinese numbering system via edX's <a href="https://www.edx.org/school/mandarinx">MandarinX</a> course and was learning the  separate symbols for 1, 10, 100, &amp; 1000 (<lang = "zh">一, 十, 一百, 一千</lang>, respectively). Then it gets interesting, Chinese has symbols for 10,000 (<lang = "zh">一万</lang>) and doesn't have another new symbol until 100,000,000 (<lang = "zh">一亿</lang>). Why 10,000 and 100,000,000? Then I thought back to my toy numbering system. Notice any similarities?</p>

<h3 id="a-modest-proposal">A Modest Proposal</h3>

<p>I do not believe that changing the Western number system is a reasonable expectation. After all, the Metric system (ok, "SI") has been around for several hundred years and the US is still stuck on the Imperial system for most things. We still use miles, pounds per square inch, and degrees Fahrenheit; but there's hope: I recently ran a 5K (5 kilometer) race, my mechanic has to use Metric wrenches on my and others' cars, and we buy bottles of soda and hooch in Liters (750 mL, 1.5 L, or 2 L). So perhaps there might be room for the -yllion system or maybe my modified -yllion system. Given the huge increase in drive sizes over the last 20 years, we are quickly running out of ways to describe their units of capacity. 25ish years ago, I thought that I was pretty hot stuff with my 20 MB (~ 20,971,520 Bytes) RLL hard drive. 1 decade later, I was thinking that my 250 GB (~ 268,435,456,000 Bytes) PATA drive was pretty hot stuff. A decade later, yesterday, I saw a 6 TB (~ 6,597,069,766,656 Bytes) drive array on sale for the same price I bought my first 20 MB hard drive. What's my point? The drives I'm describing are consumer-grade drives. In the IT-world, consumer-grade size is laughable. 15 years ago, I had heard an NPR report stating that the total size of data on the Internet was estimated to be 2 Terabytes. Last year, when I left a small IT shop in a small school district, we were in talks to bring on a drive array whose size was measured in Exabytes. Exabytes. That totally bypasses the whole Petabytes unit of measurement. So, after Exabytes, what then? Zottabytes? Then what? OMGigabytes?</p>

<p>If we were to recalibrate our units of measurement for computer-based things, perhaps we could have an easier time of describing those units of measurement if we were to use a different unit of measurement.</p>

<p>Let 1000 Bytes = 1 KB. I know 1 standard KB == 1024 Bytes, but let's go with the marketing assumption that computer units are base-10. That would mean that 1 Byte is the same as 0.001 KB. Now, let's expand upon these KB units using the -yllion number system:</p>

<p>As you can see, somewhere between 10 Petabytes (1 Byllion KB) and 100 Million Yottabytes (1 Tryllion KB), we run out of SI units to describe the computer capacity. At some point, we'll either have to come up with a bunch of SI units to use with capacity, or we'll have to come up with a different way to count that capacity.</p>

<p>I expect to see capacities measured in Yottabytes within the next 20 years. Then what?</p>

            <id>http://ericpoe.com/blog/2015/07/08/php-array-filter-oddity</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was studying the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-filter.php"><code>array_filter</code></a> in PHP and was enjoying coming up with a test that could help me learn better <code>array_filter</code> magic. For instance, to filter all words whose first letter is a vowel, I created this PHPUnit test:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function testFilterVowelWords()
{
    $vowel = function ($word) {
        $vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
        return in_array($word[0], $vowels);
    };

    $words = ["apple", "baby", "cookie", "danger", "element", "fountain", "grape"];

    $vowelWords = array_filter($words, $vowel);

    $this-&gt;assertEquals(["apple", "element"], array_values($vowelWords));
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, yay <code>array_filter</code>! But wait, what's this? There's an optional flag for <code>array_filter</code> that was introduced in PHP 5.6? It allows one to filter by array key, or if one is completely nuts, by both array value and array key. Woah.
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/giphymedia/media/yUIktdHUIamcg/giphy.gif"></p>

<p>So, if one were to filter by key, easy-peasy. The flag is <code>ARRAY_FILTER_USE_KEY</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function testFilterVowelWordsByKey()
{
    $vowel = function ($key) {
        $vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
        return in_array($key, $vowels);
    };

    $words = ["a" =&gt; "apple", "b" =&gt; "baby", "c"=&gt;"cookie", "d"=&gt;"danger", "e"=&gt;"element", "f"=&gt;"fountain", "g"=&gt;"grape"];

    $vowelWords = array_filter($words, $vowel, ARRAY_FILTER_USE_KEY);

    $this-&gt;assertEquals(["a"=&gt;"apple", "e"=&gt;"element"], $vowelWords);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, if one wanted to filter by key AND value, the flag would be <code>ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH</code>, right?</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function testFilterVowelWordsByKeyAndValue()
{
    $strange = function ($key, $value) {
        $vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
        if (in_array($key, $vowels)) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return (in_array($value[1], $vowels));
        }
    };

    $words = ["a" =&gt; "apple", "b" =&gt; "baby", "c"=&gt;"cookie", "d"=&gt;"danger", "e"=&gt;"element", "f"=&gt;"fountain", "g"=&gt;"grape"];

    $vowelWords = array_filter($words, $strange, ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH);

    $this-&gt;assertEquals(["a"=&gt;"apple", "b"=&gt;"baby", "c" =&gt; "cookie", "d" =&gt; "danger", "e" =&gt; "element", "f" =&gt; "fountain"], $vowelWords);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yet, epic fail!</p>

<p>The <code>ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH</code> flag requires the order: <code>value</code> then <code>key</code> NOT <code>key</code> then <code>value</code></p>

<pre><code class="php">public function testFilterVowelWordsByKeyAndValue()
{
    $strange = function ($value, $key) {
        $vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
        if (in_array($value[1], $vowels)) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return (in_array($key, $vowels));
        }
    };

    $words = ["a" =&gt; "apple", "b" =&gt; "baby", "c"=&gt;"cookie", "d"=&gt;"danger", "e"=&gt;"element", "f"=&gt;"fountain", "g"=&gt;"grape"];

    $vowelWords = array_filter($words, $strange, ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH);

    $this-&gt;assertEquals(["a"=&gt;"apple", "b"=&gt;"baby", "c" =&gt; "cookie", "d" =&gt; "danger", "e" =&gt; "element", "f" =&gt; "fountain"], $vowelWords);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yay! This test passes! But, what the heck? Why <code>value</code> then <code>key</code>? Every time we read about <code>key =&gt; value</code> pairs, it's in the order of <code>key</code> then <code>value</code>. Yet, this is <code>value</code> then <code>key</code>. What gives?</p>

<p>I looked into this. I couldn't find any <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc">RFCs</a> recommending this order. I even checked PHP internals discussions and saw the question raised of <a href="http://marc.info/?l=php-internals&amp;m=137159339704961&amp;w=2">which should come first, key or value</a>, but the question doesn't get answered. Eventually, we get a statement of (paraphrased)<a href="http://marc.info/?l=php-internals&amp;m=138023845322301&amp;w=2">"Hey, having flags for using key or using both key &amp; value is great, I'll add it."</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/287">pull request</a>, though it contains discussion on adding this flag, doesn't contain any discussion on parameter order. The <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/ext/standard/array.c#L4803">source code</a> does not contain enough documentation to give an inkling as to why this is.</p>

<p>I struggled to figure out a good reason for <code>value</code> to come before <code>key</code> when using the <code>ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH</code> flag. In desperation, I reached out to the PHP Internals dev who implemented this feature, Tjerk Meesters (aka '<a href="https://twitter.com/datibbaW">datibbaw</a>'). As an exemplar of where the amazing PHP community shines, Tjerk responded within minutes with helpful background information on this feature. First, this feature was designed to not break existing implementations of <code>array_filter</code>. Adding <code>key</code> as the second parameter seemed to be the most polite way to do this. Secondly, this is the same order as used in JavaScript's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter">Array.prototype.filter()</a>. Boom.</p>

<p>The way I justify the order is by looking at the original intent of <code>array_filter</code> -- it was designed to filter an array based on the values contained within that array. So, value is first and foremost the primary thing this function checks against; the key is merely secondary. Therefore, when using the <code>ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH</code> flag, the order of parameters for the callback will be <code>value</code> and then <code>key</code>.</p>

<p>If I were to treat this function as a consumer that turns food into another product, the main food this function eats is the value platter. For dessert, it might choose to eat a key lime pie. Or it might decide to order the full course and ask for both the value platter with dessert.</p>

<p>What had seemed like an oddity at first now makes sense in the right frame of mind. If you use <code>array_filter</code>, remember that it is all about the array <code>value</code>. If you want to include the <code>key</code> in the filter, know that <code>key</code> is always secondary to the original intent.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I attended Lone Star PHP <a href="/blog/2014/05/06/Lonestar-PHP-Conference-2014">last year</a> with much hope and even more trepidation as to my abilities to hold my own with other members of the PHP community. I was the recipient of the Lone Star PHP scholarship, so my attendance and stay were taken care of by the conference sponsors (thank you! thank you! thank you!). I spent a day at an intro-to-PHP workshop, where I realized that I knew more about modern PHP and its practices than I cared to admit. I spent another day attending great talks. I met many wonderful folks, some of whom I have maintained contact and some PHP luminaries I follow on Twitter, blog posts, and podcasts. Since I had accepted a job offer while doing the TSA dance at DFW airport, I spent my evenings leaving the after-parties early to work on my resignation letter.</p>

<p>This year was my sophomore attendance, so I attended with a less timid attitude, a lifetime more of experience, an established and beloved career, and looking forward to the talks I would attend, the friends I would see again, and the new friends I would make. This time, my employer, <a href="http://stowers.org">Stowers Institute for Medical Research</a> sent me (thank you!). This time around, I found that I was able to offer more to the conference than I had before. I connected at least one attendee to his <a href="http://devict.org/">local user group</a>, talked up <a href="http://nomadphp.com/">NomadPHP</a> and <a href="https://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo</a>, and was able to explain some of the awesomeness of <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>. I also attended great talks and workshops and met some amazing folks.</p>

<p>Lone Star is a regional conference, has world-class talks, and feels like a community. Many of the speakers know each other and hang out together for the several days of the conference (and sometimes even a day or so later). Yet, even though many of the speakers are friends with each other, they are open and welcoming to outsiders like me.</p>

<p>The business value for attending the conference is in the talks themselves. I was able to take concepts from at least two talks and apply them to code I was working on for work the following week. The long-term value will be seen by my employer later as I apply lessons learned from the various intellectual paths opened to me by all of the talks.</p>

<p>The reason I will attend Lone Star again is for what happens outside of the talks. The "hallway track" is a part of this. I attended two talks I didn't expect to attend due to having good conversations with attendees after a talk that <del>were interrupted</del> were followed by a great talk in the same room.</p>

<p>The lunches provided by the conference sponsors were great. Day 0's lunch was off, schedule-wise, in that the line went pretty far back; yet, I had several great conversations with great people while waiting in line, talked with Adam Culp about his long-distance running and learned of his new <a href="https://rungeekradio.com/">podcast</a>, and had Ben Ramsey sign my copy of the 3rd edition of the <a href="http://www.phparch.com/books/zend-php-5-certification-study-guide-3rd-edition/">Zend Certification Guide</a> (Davey Shafik signed it Saturday night). Friday's lunch was fajitas and Saturday's was Texas BBQ. Yum. Funny aside: on one of the lunches, forks were more popular than were available; so I grabbed two plastic knives and used them like chopsticks to eat my lunch -- I felt like I was epitomizing the <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-php-singularity/">double-clawed hammer</a> of PHP. Thank you, <a href="http://www.phpdevhired.com/">PHPDevHired</a> and <a href="http://www.robofirm.com/">Robofirm</a> for sponsoring the lunches!</p>

<p>The hallway track at Lone Star was pretty awesome. I met an Austin-based dev team from Whole Foods, user group leaders from around the United States, many Texas-based developers, speakers and other luminaries of the PHP community, and people I had met last year. At one point, I saw various speakers in the hallway and asked if they were "the hallway track or the rogue's gallery;" one responded that they were in detention.</p>

<p>The after-parties were low key and were largely an extension of the hallway track. <a href="http://omni-spot.blogspot.com/">Omni Adams</a> provided his awesome homebrew beers -- incredibly, they have improved from last year's perfection. I missed the <a href="http://looselycoupled.info/">Loosely Coupled</a> podcast Friday night due to being caught up with great conversations with members of the community. Saturday night, I was able to take part in the fun "<a href="https://github.com/jeremeamia/JeoPHPardy">PHP Jeopardy</a>" game, where I forgot everything I knew. I was honored to take part in the "It's the booze talking" edition of the <a href="https://voicesoftheelephpant.com/">Voices of the Elephant</a> podcast. Thank you, <a href="https://www.sparefoot.com/">SpareFoot</a> and <a href="http://www.softlayer.com/">SoftLayer</a> for sponsoring the after-parties!</p>

<p>Following the after-parties, groups of us got together to have dinner, hit a karaoke bar, and in the midst of Dallas thundersqualls, have drinks at the hotel the speakers were staying at and engage in great conversations. (Thank you, OKC <a href="https://twitter.com/jakeasmith">Jake Smith</a> &amp; crew for providing transportation!)</p>

<p>I had submitted a couple of talks that weren't accepted; yet I did not attend any talks that made me think "they turned my talk down for this?" Even the duds were golden!</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This was a great conference. The Dallas PHP community and the Lone Star organizers are to be commended on providing such a great conference. The cost of admission is perfect for those entering PHP development (or attending locally) and the caliber of talks are perfect for those who are presently engaged in PHP development (or attending from afar). The after-parties are great for adults away from their families, yet fun for locals to bring their families.</p>

<p>I met many wonderful people and learned much that will benefit both my employer and myself.</p>

<p>I will be back. Next time, I hope, with a talk in my pocket.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first day of Lone Star 2015 was devoted to training. The workshop track I took was geared towards unit testing.</p>

<h3 id="getting-started-with-phpunit">Getting Started with PHPUnit</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://shortwhitebaldguy.com/">Matt Frost</a></li>
<li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/shrtwhitebldguy">@shrtwhitebldguy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mfrost503/getting-startedphp-unit">Slides</a></li>
</ul>

<p>One reason I took this workshop was so that I could become more familiar with mocks. I had a mental block when it comes to mocks and had a hard time seeing their value. After taking this workshop and talking about mocks with Matt, I can see and appreciate their value. Mock the things we don't directly test (ex. database connections, sql queries, filesystem i/o, etc) to speed up the individual unit tests. Mock the things we don't directly control (ex. 3rd-party API, access to another server on our network, etc) since we don't want to fail a test due to a temporary connection error.</p>

<p>What I loved about this workshop was the easy-going manner in which Matt got us to embrace unit testing and mocking. Matt even provided a <a href="https://github.com/mfrost503/phpunit-tutorial">git repo</a> for us to clone in order to get started on the fun part of the workshop. Mocking was definitely covered in the interactive part of the workshop.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our getting started on the interactive portion of the workshop was delayed due to poor wifi signal. By the time most of us were able to get the git repo cloned and run <code>composer install</code>, we only had time to do one of the two mocking exercises. Yet, since I still have the repo cloned on my machine, there's no reason I shouldn't be able to finish the workshop at my leisure.</p>

<h3 id="wax-on%2C-wax-off%3A-coder-dojo">Wax On, Wax Off: Coder Dojo</h3>

<li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/coderabbi">@coderabbi</a></li>
<li>Slides unavailable</li>
</ul>

<p>I have <a href="/blog/2014/12/22/a-tdd-fizz-buzz-kata">done kata</a> before and am a proponent of using them to strengthen knowledge and skills, so this was a workshop I had mentally signed up for as soon as I heard it was being offered.</p>

<p>Rabbi Yitzchok Willroth (aka "CodeRabbi") leads his audience with gentle enthusiasm through an intellectual exercise replete with philosophy and references to psychological studies. During this workshop, Coderabbi had a few friends (luminaries of the PHP community, really) float around to offer guidance to the perplexed during each kata exercise. Their assistance was much appreciated.</p>

<p>The kata we worked on was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>. We did not have the remainder of the workshop to work on this kata. Instead, we had 30 minutes (you read that right) to work on it. Since this is not something one can learn the rules to and code in a sitting, this seemed unfair -- like being told that the <a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml">Couch-to-5K</a> program we were going to follow is to get off the couch and then run 5 kilometers in 30 minutes. As you can imagine, the beginning runner will not complete 5K in 30 minutes, but eventually will with repeated practice. So, too, can one eventually completely code the Game of Life in 30 minutes with repeated practice. What seemed unfair initially, was really a challenge to us to improve, continuously.</p>

<p>One aspect of this workshop that I enjoyed was that at the end of every 30 minute sprint, we were to discard our previous work and start fresh, but with a new constraint to keep our minds sharp. So the second sprint's constraint was to pair up with someone else and see what we could do together. After 30 minutes, the constraint was to make the Cell or Organism (whatever we called it) class not maintain state.</p>

<p>There were times in these kata exercises in which I felt frustrated or angry. Good! For an intellectual exercise, this is the equivalent to feeling muscle strain and soreness in a weight-resistance exercise.</p>

<p>My first pair-up was with a guy who wanted to do the kata in object-oriented javascript and use HTM5 Canvas. At a PHP conference. Yet, once I embraced that he had a better plan of attack than I did, I enjoyed the learning process of watching someone code in a manner that I do not. In that instance, I was not a good pair-partner since I had nothing to contribute regarding Canvas nor from-scratch OOJS. Yet it was a good exercise.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the intellectual exercise of making the Cell Class stateless in that it gave my pair-partner and me the opportunity to discuss what that meant and how to deal with that constraint. We didn't end up with more than an incomplete sketch (in the form of code), but it got our brain juices flowing.</p>

<p>I plan to play with this kata some more on my own and will add additional rules to perhaps mimic competing organisms in the same space. Or, what if one of these organisms has a completely foreign set of rules (like, perhaps cancer cells)?</p>

<p>We started with a Composer-based <a href="https://github.com/coderabbi/coder-dojo">PHPUnit skeleton</a> and a <a href="http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?action=browse&amp;diff=1&amp;id=KataGameOfLife">complicated kata</a>. We ended up with a newfound respect for the squishy gray stuff between our ears.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This was the first year that Lone Star PHP had a day devoted to training. The problems we all shared with wifi were frustrating, but overcome personally by my attendee-coworker with a call to our IT department to turn on the ability to hotspot our phones (thanks, Darren!). A glance at all the <a href="https://twitter.com/sdawncasey/status/589097774852935680">Wifi access points</a> at the conference center showed that we were not the only ones to do this. But really, for the workshops, wifi wasn't important except for at the beginning of each workshop so we could clone git repos and run <code>composer install</code>.</p>

<p>The night before the workshop, I had built a vagrant box exclusively for use at the conference. <a href="https://twitter.com/juantreminio">Juan Treminio</a>'s (a speaker at Lone Star PHP 2014!) <a href="https://puphpet.com/">Puphpet</a> tool proved to be invaluable for this purpose. Had I been aware of the need to clone git repos and get the required components installed via composer, I would have done so ahead of time.</p>

<p>In short, the workshops were great, yet too much time was wasted by all in doing something that takes maybe a minute on the office or hotel wifi but takes for-frikkin-ever on a shared conference wifi. I would like to see more notice next time for required environments so we can hit the ground running. The topics were great, and I would have loved to have been able to attend them all!</p>

            <title type="html"><![CDATA[Bite of PHP: Heredoc vs. Nowdoc]]></title>
            <link href="http://ericpoe.com/blog/2015/04/23/heredoc-vs-nowdoc"/>
            <updated>2015-04-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>http://ericpoe.com/blog/2015/04/23/heredoc-vs-nowdoc</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="heredoc">Heredoc</h3>

<p>Heredoc will define a string of text in a what-you-see-is-what-you-mean type
of format. So, if you want to echo out structured text, like so:</p>

<pre><code class="html">I think that I
    Shall never pay
As much as I
    Have for 2015-04-23
</code></pre>

<p>You would put it in a heredoc like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$today = date('Y-m-d');
$poem = &lt;&lt;&lt;HTML
I think that I
    Shall never pay
As much as I
    Have for $today
HTML;

echo $poem;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>output:</strong></p>

<pre>
I think that I
    Shall never pay
As much as I
    Have for 2015-04-23
</pre>

<p>Notice that heredoc can behave like a template and parse any PHP contained within.</p>

<p>Test it out on <a href="http://3v4l.org/GZl9Z">3v4l.org</a>.</p>

<h3 id="nowdoc">Nowdoc</h3>

<p>Nowdoc will define a string of text in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get type of format. So, if you want to show the above example EXACTLY as written, put it in a nowdoc block.</p>

<pre><code class="php">$today = date('Y-m-d');
$poem = &lt;&lt;&lt;'HTML'
I think that I
    Shall never pay
As much as I
    Have for $today
HTML;

echo $poem;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>output:</strong></p>

<pre>
I think that I
    Shall never pay
As much as I
    Have for $today
</pre>

<p>Test it out on <a href="http://3v4l.org/H1YjU">3v4l.org</a>.</p>

<p>Notice that the only difference between the heredoc block and the nowdoc block is that the nowdoc block's name is enclosed within single-quotes. For me, the single-quotes makes it easy to remember which block is literal and which block is rendered, just like the <a href="/blog/2015/03/04/double-vs-single-quote-echo/">difference between echoing single-quotes and double-quotes</a>.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In PHP, we have two ways of formatting an echo statement: we can choose to
use single-quotes or double-quotes. The choice is less dependent upon which
side of the Atlantic we learned to read and more dependent upon what we hope
to accomplish with echoing that string.</p>

<p>If you want to echo the string without parsing it, use single-quotes. If you
want to parse the string while echoing it, use double-quotes. Observe:</p>

<p><strong>Single-Quote Example</strong></p>

<pre><code class="php">$greeting = "Howdy";
$audience = "World";
echo '$greeting, $audience';
</code></pre>

<p><em>Output:</em> <code>$greeting, $audience</code></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Double-Quote Example</strong></p>

<pre><code class="php">$greeting = "Howdy";
$audience = "World";
echo "$greeting, $audience";
</code></pre>

<p><em>Output:</em> <code>Howdy, World</code></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>What if you want to add a character to the output of one of those variables?
Just enclose the variable in a curly bracket!</p>

<p><strong>Special Double-Quote Example</strong></p>

<pre><code class="php">$greeting = "Howdy";
$audience = "World";
echo "$greeting, {$audience}!";
</code></pre>

<p><em>Output:</em> <code>Howdy, World!</code></p>

<p><br></p>
