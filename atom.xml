            <link href="http://ericpoe.com/blog/2016/01/26/playing-with-docker"/>
            <updated>2016-01-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>http://ericpoe.com/blog/2016/01/26/playing-with-docker</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my current job, I am starting the process to upgrade our PHP 5.4 application to a PHP 5.6 application (PHP 7 is not yet support by the majority of the 3rd party libraries we use). I have been tasked with building the staging server for use in testing our legacy application as well as our newer Symfony-based application. We are using an older version of MySQL as well.</p>

<p>At some point, we will want to experiment with PHP 7.x and later versions of MySQL or MariaDB. Yet, will we want to build a brand new server each time?</p>

<p>This seems like a perfect opportunity to play with <a href="http://docker.io">Docker</a>.</p>

<p>I had first looked at Docker a little over a year ago. I had tried to build a dev environment entirely from Docker, but it and I were not yet ready for each other. I could not see Docker as anything other than another way to launch a Vagrant box for development.</p>

<p>This weekend, I looked at Docker again. Now Docker includes a feature called "<a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a>." This allows one to build a Docker manifest within a YAML file rather than as a complex command-line string.</p>

<p>I played. I looked at building a new Drupal 8 box with a separate MySQL server. As a docker-compose YAML file, this is pretty straight-forward:</p>

<p><code>docker-compose.yml</code></p>

<pre><code class="yaml">drupal8:
  image: drupal
  links:
    - drupal_database:mysql
  ports:
    - 8085:80
drupal_database:
  container_name: drupal_database
  image: mariadb:5.5
  environment:
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: examplepass
    MYSQL_USER: user
    MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
    MYSQL_DATABASE: drupal_db
</code></pre>

<p>The above creates two Docker machines: "drupal8" and "drupal_database." The "drupal8" Docker machine is linked to the "drupal_database" which is running MariaDB 5.5. To launch this, I just run <code>docker-compose up</code> from the directory that contains this <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file. This is the equivalent to running:</p>

<pre><code>docker run --name drupal_database \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=examplepass \
  -e MYSQL_USER=user \
  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=password \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=drupal_db \
  -d mariadb:5.5

docker run --name drupal8 \
  -p 8085:80 \
  --link drupal_database:mysql \
  -d drupal
</code></pre>

<p>I was able to come up with a working <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file within 30 minutes. It took me much longer to come up with the right <code>docker run</code> statements to make two Docker containers and have the Drupal container link to the MySQL container. Natch, had I read further down the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/drupal/">Docker Hub Drupal page</a>, I would have been given a huge clue as to how to connect the two; I just needed to add the appropriate port. Nonetheless, the YAML is much easier me to configure and update than the two <code>docker run</code> commands are.</p>

            <link href="http://ericpoe.com/blog/2015/11/29/dev-expectation-vs-dev-reality"/>
            <updated>2015-11-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>http://ericpoe.com/blog/2015/11/29/dev-expectation-vs-dev-reality</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been a professional developer for over a year and a half now.</p>

<p>About a year ago, my friend and mentor, John Kary, asked me how the job measured up to my expectations. I replied, honestly, that my expectations were met. However, I hadn't given it much thought since I was busy trying to learn so many new things. So, at the time, my expectation was that new developers spend a lot of time learning new things. Expectation: met.</p>

<p>Since that time, I have continued to learn new things, but I have also had time to think about the question more in depth.</p>

<p>I realized that I had many expectations of dev-life while I was studying programming.</p>

<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> Your mileage may vary</p>

<h3 id="expectation-1---programming-is-a-young-man%27s-game">Expectation 1 - Programming is a Young Man's Game</h3>

<p>This was probably my largest fear with changing my career and entering programming as a full-time job. I had read too much about <em>brogramming</em>, sexism, and ageism being rampant in the development world. As a middle-aged dude, I was worried about entering this career that was run by 20-something guys that call each other "bruh."</p>

<h3 id="reality-1---programming-is-open-to-all">Reality 1 - Programming is Open to All</h3>

<p>My first interview for my job was with a female boss and a potential coworker who was older than me and was also female. I have told both of them since that this put my fears to rest and made the rest of the interview-process much easier. My second interview was with the team, which was made up of the female boss, the older-than-me female developer, a younger female developer, a remote guy via robot interface, a younger guy, and my friend, John Kary. Another member of the team was absent due to his grandson being born.</p>

<p>Since that time, we have hired a guy from Pakistan, a slightly younger guy, a slightly older guy, and a much younger guy. I would like to see more women apply for the job openings. Perhaps next time.</p>

<h3 id="expectation-2---programming-requires-uml">Expectation 2 - Programming Requires UML</h3>

<p>My programming classes utilized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language" title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</a>, the various textbooks and other programming books also utilized UML. So, I imagined that dev meetings utilized UML on a dry-erase board.</p>

<h3 id="reality-2---learning-requires-uml">Reality 2 - Learning Requires UML</h3>

<p>In various team meetings, 1-on-1 dev meetings, and informal discussions, I have yet to see UML be utilized.</p>

<h3 id="expectation-3---developers-have-a-computer-science-degree">Expectation 3 - Developers Have a Computer Science Degree</h3>

<p>I imagined developer discussions being in some meta-language that incorporated algorithms, Big-O notation, and obscure design patterns.</p>

<h3 id="reality-3---developers-come-from-all-walks-of-life">Reality 3 - Developers Come From All Walks of Life</h3>

<p>Perhaps half of my team has some kind of Computer Science background and degree. Other members of my team have backgrounds in varied subjects from construction to film-studies.</p>

<p>In listening the various podcasts and attending various conferences and user-group meetings, I think that there is no fairly typical developer background. One can expect someone with a computer-science degree, but there are plenty of good developers out there without a degree, much less a computer-science degree.</p>

<h3 id="expectation-4---developers-are-invested-in-their-community">Expectation 4 - Developers Are Invested In Their Community</h3>

<p>I was a member of a developer community a decade before I became a professional developer. I have gone to developer conferences in Kansas City and Dallas and have met with many developers from those communities. I expected that all developers were interested in meeting with and working with developers from their community outside of their 9-to-5 job.</p>

<h3 id="reality-4---developers-come-from-all-walks-of-life">Reality 4 - Developers Come From All Walks of Life</h3>

<p>I know that this is the same as &#35;3; however, it fits here, too.</p>

<p>I have also met plenty of developers whom I have tried to recruit to join a local user group, yet they gave a non-committal "I'll look into it" when pressed. Most developers whom I have met are interested in programming for the 40-hours a week they are contracted to program. Outside of that time, they are interested in pursuing their own interests: wood-working, beer brewing, robot fighting, knitting, parade-float building, running, &amp; etc.</p>

<p>Even for me, family is my number 1 priority. Yet, I devote time to organizing a PHP User Group, planning and mentoring a <a href="http://coderdojokc.com/">CoderDojo</a>, and studying programming concepts and technologies outside of work.</p>

<h3 id="expectation-5---if-you-don%27t-play-reindeer-games%2C-you-don%27t-belong">Expectation 5 - If You Don't Play Reindeer Games, You Don't Belong</h3>

<p>What I knew of programmers is what I knew from media and my nerd friends. <a href="https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/">Cards Against Humanity</a>, Dungeons and Dragons, comic books, video games, Star Wars/Trek, and pop-culture ephemera rule developer society.</p>

<h3 id="reality-5---developers-come-from-all-walks-of-life">Reality 5 - Developers Come From All Walks of Life</h3>

<p>Guess what? Developer !== Dork. You might know some developers who fall into that stereotype, but you probably know others who have interests outside of developer stereotypes.</p>

<p>I have yet to play Cards Against Humanity at work. Yet, I have played it once after a CoderDojo session. I have had several Star Wars/Trek discussions with coworkers, but not all coworkers.</p>

<p>At lunch, we mostly talk about family and recent events in our lives. I have recently started a dev book club with my team for a once-per-week lunch discussion. Some of us gather once per month for <a href="http://nomadphp.com">NomadPHP</a> with a follow-up discussion.</p>

<h3 id="expectation-6---memes-are-huge">Expectation 6 - Memes Are Huge</h3>

<p>Before I got my job, I started reading <a href="https://reddit.com">reddit</a>. One thing that I learned is that memes are huge. So I ran through a bunch of memes on <a href="http://memegenerator.net/">meme generator</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reality-6---memes-are-huge-for-some">Reality 6 - Memes Are Huge for Some</h3>

<p>Memes are memes because they are memes. That's tautology for you.</p>

<p>Memes are drawn from popular culture. So, when I was a kid, saying "This is not the assignment you're looking for" was utilizing a meme. We just didn't call it that. 15 years ago, saying to a friend, "Wassup!" was utilizing a meme. We just didn't call it that.</p>

<p>So now, with the easy usage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji">emoji</a> and the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/ac-koa-hipchat-sassy"><code>/meme</code></a> command in HipChat, memes are all too easy to utilize in a textual discussion.</p>

<p>Yet, not all of us know what the heck some of these memes mean. And some don't even bother with using memes in textual discussion. Memes tend to be a shibboleth in a team when a team shouldn't require such watch-words or phrases.</p>

<h3 id="expectation-7---programmers-are-a-monoculture">Expectation 7 - Programmers are a Monoculture</h3>

<p>When attending a conference, it's easy to see that the vast majority of attendees are younger white guys. The lines to the men's room are long whereas the lines to the ladies' room are non-existant. All programmers are heavy into nerd-core and oontz-oontz electronic music.</p>

<h3 id="reality-7-%26-conclusion---developers-come-from-all-walks-of-life">Reality 7 &amp; Conclusion - Developers Come From All Walks of Life</h3>

<p>This, I think, is the ultimate expectation. All of the expectations above reflect this expectation.</p>

<p>When I was a CS student, classmates were from various genders, sexual orientations, ethnic backgrounds, races, and religions. This expectation was already smashed.</p>

<p>When I joined the league of professional programmers, I met programmers from all walks of life: programmers who grew up dirt poor and programmers who grew up with plenty; programmers who grew up steeped in nerd-core and programmers who came about it quite accidentally.</p>

<p>I am a middle-aged white guy. Yet, I've only been in this game professionally for 1.5 years. I have a lifetime of experience behind me in jobs &amp; a career other than programming. You could take a glance at me and think that I am the very model of a modern career programmer. Yet, you could not be more wrong.</p>

            <id>http://ericpoe.com/blog/2015/11/13/my-year-of-code</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2015 was my year to really dive into PHP. Up until this year, PHP was  hobby language for me -- much as Python, Haskell, C++, Dart, JavaScript, and Java have been hobby languages. Granted, last year I finally took a job where PHP is where I spend half of my time.</p>

<p>This year, I took up intensive study of PHP. At the beginning of the year, I poured over the <a href="http://www.phparch.com/books/zend-php-5-certification-study-guide-3rd-edition/">Zend PHP 5 Certification Study Guide, Third Edition</a> by Davey Shafik and Ben Ramsey. I even passed the <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/php-5-certification">Zend Certified PHP Engineer exam</a> and earned my <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND027285">Zend Certification</a>. I also took up more of a leadership role in my local PHP user group, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/kcphpug/">KCPHPUG</a>, gave a few talks, and have been hosting meetups both at work and at a local café. In the late Spring/early Summer, I began work on a PHP library called <a href="https://github.com/ericpoe/ophp">OPHP</a>. In April, I attended the <a href="http://lonestarphp.com/">Lone Star PHP conference</a> and got to meet and hang out with quite a few luminaries of the community.</p>

<p>I think I can safely say that 2015 has been a year of PHP for me.</p>

<p>For next year, my language of intensive study will be JavaScript. No matter who I talk with about programming, JavaScript seems to be the <em>lingua franca</em> of web programming. I have already started to look deeply into Sencha's <a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs">Ext JS</a>, which is the JavaScript framework we use at work. <a href="http://es6-features.org/">EcmaScript 6</a> has piqued my interest since it was ratified in June. I have also been interested in learning more about <a href="https://nodejs.org">node</a> since it has usage in <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Atom Electron</a> and beyond.</p>

<p>By this time next year, I hope to have a native comfort in JavaScript.</p>

            <updated>2015-07-16T22:42:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>http://ericpoe.com/blog/2015/07/16/number-system-time-for-a-change</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been thinking about numbers for most of my life. It wasn't until I helped my oldest child learn to count to 20 that I thought that the way we count in the English language is silly. There is no logic in our base-10 counting system until we get to 17: "fif teen" (what's a "fif?") is followed by "six teen" (ah, six is a number I recognize!) which is followed by "seven teen" (aha! seven is another number I recognize!). And this got me thinking that surely there's a better way to count.</p>

<p>Soon thereafter, I started finding a better way to count in a chapter of Malcolm Gladwell's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017930/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0316017930&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=erpo0f-20&amp;linkId=AZHPZTBIYAL52CGL">Outliers</a>. Gladwell posits that <a href="http://gladwell.com/outliers/rice-paddies-and-math-tests/">Chinese-speaking kids can memorize multi-digit numbers much faster than English-speaking kids can</a> since the sequence "4, 8, 5, 3, 9, 7, 6" is made up of monosyllabic words in Chinese and "7" has 2 syllables in English. I would add that since Chinese is a tonal language, this sequence also has its own tune. Quick show of hands, who knows the 7-digit phone number from the Tommy Tutone hit, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTdTwcmxyo">Jenny</a>" from 1981? Do you know that number because you can sing the number or because you can recite the number?</p>

<p>In the same chapter, Gladwell suggests that adding numbers in Chinese is easier than in English because the names of the numbers are more logical in Chinese than in English. For instance, the number 25 is "twenty-five" in English and the equivalent to "two ten five" in Chinese. Aha! Then 11 is "ten 1" in Chinese and 123 is "hundred two-ten three" in Chinese. In English (and <lang = "es">En español</lang> ), the numbers between 11 and 15 are hard to memorize. In Chinese, pshh: "ten one," "ten two," "ten three," "ten four," "ten five."</p>

<p>This made me think that perhaps learning numbers would be easier if we came up with different units. If we were to count "0 - 10" in the standard English manner, then "11 - 19" would be known as "ten one," "ten two," "ten three," &amp; etc. "20 - 29" would be "two-ten," "two-ten one," "two-ten two," "two-ten three," &amp; etc.</p>

<p>Already, "1200" can be read two different ways in English, "One thousand two hundred" and "Twelve hundred.". It wouldn't be too large of a stretch for "1000" to no longer be known as "one thousand" but to be known as "ten hundred." Instead, "10000" would be known as "one thousand." Since the place names are changed in an exponential-growth pattern, this probably should be written as "1,0000" (10^4 or 100 hundreds) instead of "10,000." I could then call 1,0000,0000 "1 million" (10^8 or 1 thousand thousands) instead of "100 million," and 1,0000,0000,0000,0000 (10^16 or 1 million millions) "1 billion" instead of "10 quintillion."</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
    <th>Place</th>
    <th>10^0</th>
    <th>10^1</th>
    <th>10^2</th>
    <th>10^4</th>
    <th>10^8</th>
    <th>10^16</th>
    <th>10^32</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Place Name</th>
    <td>Ones</td>
    <td>Tens</td>
    <td>Hundreds</td>
    <td>Thousands</td>
    <td>Millions</td>
    <td>Billions</td>
    <td>Trillions</td>

</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Smallest Example</th>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>100</td>
    <td>1,0000</td>
    <td>1,0000,<wbr>0000</td>
    <td>1,0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000</td>
    <td>1,0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000,<wbr>0000</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In my numbering system, I might also shorten two names: "seven" becomes "sep" and "tens" become "-ty"(pronounced like "tea")." 10 - 20 would be read as:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
    <th>Number</th>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>11</td>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>13</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>17</td>
    <td>18</td>
    <td>19</td>
    <td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <td>Onety</td>
    <td>Onety-one</td>
    <td>Onety-two</td>
    <td>Onety-three</td>
    <td>Onety-four</td>
    <td>Onety-five</td>
    <td>Onety-six</td>
    <td>Onety-sep</td>
    <td>Onety-eight</td>
    <td>Onety-nine</td>
    <td>Twoty</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Already there's some logic to the number names. The place names would be recursive like so:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
    <th>Number</th>
    <th>English Name</th>
    <th>New Name</th>

    <td>5</td>

<h3 id="it%27s-already-been-done">It's Already Been Done</h3>

<p>While thinking of this numbering system, I found out that one of my programming heroes, Donald Knuth, had come up with a very similar alternative almost 30 years prior (1981 - same year as Tommy Tutone's number-memorization hit mentioned above -- coincidence?). His system is called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-yllion">-yllion</a>" and is also influenced by the Chinese number system, has exponential binary growth, grouping digits in fours, renames some of the numbers, and has recursive naming. Knuth gets rid of "thousand" and replaces it with "myriad;" "million," "billion," etc become "myllion," "byllion," etc. I thought it would be great to use a combination of the two, especially for insanely large numbers.</p>

<p>While driving or working, I would count things in this manner until it became second-nature to me. Then I realized that knowing a secret language that has a global speaker count of 1 is not a good thing. I could either spread my idea by conquering and burning the world ala Genghis Khan or I could quietly give up. I chose the more gentle option.</p>

<h3 id="the-chinese-connection">The Chinese Connection</h3>

<p>Fast forward to a few nights ago. I was studying the Chinese numbering system via edX's <a href="https://www.edx.org/school/mandarinx">MandarinX</a> course and was learning the  separate symbols for 1, 10, 100, &amp; 1000 (<lang = "zh">一, 十, 一百, 一千</lang>, respectively). Then it gets interesting, Chinese has symbols for 10,000 (<lang = "zh">一万</lang>) and doesn't have another new symbol until 100,000,000 (<lang = "zh">一亿</lang>). Why 10,000 and 100,000,000? Then I thought back to my toy numbering system. Notice any similarities?</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">

<h3 id="a-modest-proposal">A Modest Proposal</h3>

<p>I do not believe that changing the Western number system is a reasonable expectation. After all, the Metric system (ok, "SI") has been around for several hundred years and the US is still stuck on the Imperial system for most things. We still use miles, pounds per square inch, and degrees Fahrenheit; but there's hope: I recently ran a 5K (5 kilometer) race, my mechanic has to use Metric wrenches on my and others' cars, and we buy bottles of soda and hooch in Liters (750 mL, 1.5 L, or 2 L). So perhaps there might be room for the -yllion system or maybe my modified -yllion system. Given the huge increase in drive sizes over the last 20 years, we are quickly running out of ways to describe their units of capacity. 25ish years ago, I thought that I was pretty hot stuff with my 20 MB (~ 20,971,520 Bytes) RLL hard drive. 1 decade later, I was thinking that my 250 GB (~ 268,435,456,000 Bytes) PATA drive was pretty hot stuff. A decade later, yesterday, I saw a 6 TB (~ 6,597,069,766,656 Bytes) drive array on sale for the same price I bought my first 20 MB hard drive. What's my point? The drives I'm describing are consumer-grade drives. In the IT-world, consumer-grade size is laughable. 15 years ago, I had heard an NPR report stating that the total size of data on the Internet was estimated to be 2 Terabytes. Last year, when I left a small IT shop in a small school district, we were in talks to bring on a drive array whose size was measured in Exabytes. Exabytes. That totally bypasses the whole Petabytes unit of measurement. So, after Exabytes, what then? Zottabytes? Then what? OMGigabytes?</p>

<p>If we were to recalibrate our units of measurement for computer-based things, perhaps we could have an easier time of describing those units of measurement if we were to use a different unit of measurement.</p>

<p>Let 1000 Bytes = 1 KB. I know 1 standard KB == 1024 Bytes, but let's go with the marketing assumption that computer units are base-10. That would mean that 1 Byte is the same as 0.001 KB. Now, let's expand upon these KB units using the -yllion number system:</p>

<p>As you can see, somewhere between 10 Petabytes (1 Byllion KB) and 100 Million Yottabytes (1 Tryllion KB), we run out of SI units to describe the computer capacity. At some point, we'll either have to come up with a bunch of SI units to use with capacity, or we'll have to come up with a different way to count that capacity.</p>

<p>I expect to see capacities measured in Yottabytes within the next 20 years. Then what?</p>

<p>So, yay <code>array_filter</code>! But wait, what's this? There's an optional flag for <code>array_filter</code> that was introduced in PHP 5.6? It allows one to filter by array key, or if one is completely nuts, by both array value and array key. Woah.

<p>So, if one were to filter by key, easy-peasy. The flag is <code>ARRAY_FILTER_USE_KEY</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function testFilterVowelWordsByKey()
{
    $vowel = function ($key) {
        $vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
        return in_array($key, $vowels);
    };

    $words = ["a" =&gt; "apple", "b" =&gt; "baby", "c"=&gt;"cookie", "d"=&gt;"danger", "e"=&gt;"element", "f"=&gt;"fountain", "g"=&gt;"grape"];

    $vowelWords = array_filter($words, $vowel, ARRAY_FILTER_USE_KEY);

    $this-&gt;assertEquals(["a"=&gt;"apple", "e"=&gt;"element"], $vowelWords);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, if one wanted to filter by key AND value, the flag would be <code>ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH</code>, right?</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function testFilterVowelWordsByKeyAndValue()
{
    $strange = function ($key, $value) {
        $vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
        if (in_array($key, $vowels)) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return (in_array($value[1], $vowels));
        }
    };

    $words = ["a" =&gt; "apple", "b" =&gt; "baby", "c"=&gt;"cookie", "d"=&gt;"danger", "e"=&gt;"element", "f"=&gt;"fountain", "g"=&gt;"grape"];

    $vowelWords = array_filter($words, $strange, ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH);

    $this-&gt;assertEquals(["a"=&gt;"apple", "b"=&gt;"baby", "c" =&gt; "cookie", "d" =&gt; "danger", "e" =&gt; "element", "f" =&gt; "fountain"], $vowelWords);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yet, epic fail!</p>

<p>The <code>ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH</code> flag requires the order: <code>value</code> then <code>key</code> NOT <code>key</code> then <code>value</code></p>

<pre><code class="php">public function testFilterVowelWordsByKeyAndValue()
{
    $strange = function ($value, $key) {
        $vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
        if (in_array($value[1], $vowels)) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return (in_array($key, $vowels));
        }
    };

    $words = ["a" =&gt; "apple", "b" =&gt; "baby", "c"=&gt;"cookie", "d"=&gt;"danger", "e"=&gt;"element", "f"=&gt;"fountain", "g"=&gt;"grape"];

    $vowelWords = array_filter($words, $strange, ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH);

    $this-&gt;assertEquals(["a"=&gt;"apple", "b"=&gt;"baby", "c" =&gt; "cookie", "d" =&gt; "danger", "e" =&gt; "element", "f" =&gt; "fountain"], $vowelWords);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yay! This test passes! But, what the heck? Why <code>value</code> then <code>key</code>? Every time we read about <code>key =&gt; value</code> pairs, it's in the order of <code>key</code> then <code>value</code>. Yet, this is <code>value</code> then <code>key</code>. What gives?</p>

<p>I looked into this. I couldn't find any <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc">RFCs</a> recommending this order. I even checked PHP internals discussions and saw the question raised of <a href="http://marc.info/?l=php-internals&amp;m=137159339704961&amp;w=2">which should come first, key or value</a>, but the question doesn't get answered. Eventually, we get a statement of (paraphrased)<a href="http://marc.info/?l=php-internals&amp;m=138023845322301&amp;w=2">"Hey, having flags for using key or using both key &amp; value is great, I'll add it."</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/287">pull request</a>, though it contains discussion on adding this flag, doesn't contain any discussion on parameter order. The <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/ext/standard/array.c#L4803">source code</a> does not contain enough documentation to give an inkling as to why this is.</p>

<p>I struggled to figure out a good reason for <code>value</code> to come before <code>key</code> when using the <code>ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH</code> flag. In desperation, I reached out to the PHP Internals dev who implemented this feature, Tjerk Meesters (aka '<a href="https://twitter.com/datibbaW">datibbaw</a>'). As an exemplar of where the amazing PHP community shines, Tjerk responded within minutes with helpful background information on this feature. First, this feature was designed to not break existing implementations of <code>array_filter</code>. Adding <code>key</code> as the second parameter seemed to be the most polite way to do this. Secondly, this is the same order as used in JavaScript's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter">Array.prototype.filter()</a>. Boom.</p>

<p>The way I justify the order is by looking at the original intent of <code>array_filter</code> -- it was designed to filter an array based on the values contained within that array. So, value is first and foremost the primary thing this function checks against; the key is merely secondary. Therefore, when using the <code>ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH</code> flag, the order of parameters for the callback will be <code>value</code> and then <code>key</code>.</p>

<p>If I were to treat this function as a consumer that turns food into another product, the main food this function eats is the value platter. For dessert, it might choose to eat a key lime pie. Or it might decide to order the full course and ask for both the value platter with dessert.</p>

<p>What had seemed like an oddity at first now makes sense in the right frame of mind. If you use <code>array_filter</code>, remember that it is all about the array <code>value</code>. If you want to include the <code>key</code> in the filter, know that <code>key</code> is always secondary to the original intent.</p>
