            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Bite of PHP: Heredoc vs Nowdoc</h3>

<h4>Heredoc</h4>

<p>Heredoc will define a string of text in a what-you-see-is-what-you-mean type
of format. So, if you want to echo out structured text, like so:</p>

<pre><code class="html">I think that I
    Shall never pay
As much as I
    Have for 2015-04-23
</code></pre>

<p>You would put it in a heredoc like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$today = date('Y-m-d');
$poem = &lt;&lt;&lt;HTML
I think that I
    Shall never pay
As much as I
    Have for $today
HTML;

echo $poem;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>output:</strong></p>

<pre>
I think that I
    Shall never pay
As much as I
    Have for 2015-04-23
</pre>

<p>Notice that heredoc can behave like a template and parse any PHP contained within.</p>

<p>Test it out on <a href="http://3v4l.org/GZl9Z">3v4l.org</a>.</p>

<h4>Nowdoc</h4>

<p>Nowdoc will define a string of text in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get type of format. So, if you want to show the above example EXACTLY as written, put it in a nowdoc block.</p>

<pre><code class="php">$today = date('Y-m-d');
$poem = &lt;&lt;&lt;'HTML'
I think that I
    Shall never pay
As much as I
    Have for $today
HTML;

echo $poem;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>output:</strong></p>

<pre>
I think that I
    Shall never pay
As much as I
    Have for $today
</pre>

<p>Test it out on <a href="http://3v4l.org/H1YjU">3v4l.org</a>.</p>

<p>Notice that the only difference between the heredoc block and the nowdoc block is that the nowdoc block's name is enclosed within single-quotes. For me, the single-quotes makes it easy to remember which block is literal and which block is rendered, just like the <a href="/blog/2015/03/04/double-vs-single-quote-echo/">difference between echoing single-quotes and double-quotes</a>.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Bite of PHP: Double vs Single Quote Echo</h3>

<p>In PHP, we have two ways of formatting an echo statement: we can choose to
use single-quotes or double-quotes. The choice is less dependant upon which
side of the Atlantic we learned to read and more dependant upon what we hope
to accomplish with echoing that string.</p>

<p>If you want to echo the string without parsing it, use single-quotes. If you
want to parse the string while echoing it, use double-quotes. Observe:</p>

<p><strong>Single-Quote Example</strong></p>

<pre><code class="php">$greeting = "Howdy";
$audience = "World";
echo '$greeting, $audience';
</code></pre>

<p><em>Output:</em> <code>$greeting, $audience</code></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Double-Quote Example</strong></p>

<pre><code class="php">$greeting = "Howdy";
$audience = "World";
echo "$greeting, $audience";
</code></pre>

<p><em>Output:</em> <code>Howdy, World</code></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>What if you want to add a character to the output of one of those variables?
Just enclose the variable in a curly bracket!</p>

<p><strong>Special Double-Quote Example</strong></p>

<pre><code class="php">$greeting = "Howdy";
$audience = "World";
echo "$greeting, {$audience}!";
</code></pre>

<p><em>Output:</em> <code>Howdy, World!</code></p>

            <link href="/blog/2014/12/22/a-tdd-fizz-buzz-kata"/>
            <updated>2014-12-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2014/12/22/a-tdd-fizz-buzz-kata</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Kata</h3>

<p>Kata are a series of movements which, when repeated, migrate mindful action into
muscle memory. An example kata is performed by <a href="http://youtu.be/iiiznDpoapQ?t=50s">Rika Usami</a>
of Japan during the 2012 World Karate Championship in Paris.</p>

<p>Kata can be thought of in terms of playing an instrument or a craft. During the
warmup before a concert, listen to the musicians. They are playing their scales
and odd passages, they are practicing their kata to get their brains and fingers
in the right place to pull off something difficult and awesome.</p>

<p><em>Kata, like scales, are temporary in nature. They are to be practiced, then discarded, then practiced again.</em></p>

<p>Programming also requires practice; kata are a great way to formalize that practice.</p>

<h3>TDD</h3>

<p>Test-Driven Development (aka "TDD") is the practice of writing a test before any
other code is written. Write a test that fails, then write the minimum of code to
pass that test, then write another test that fails, etc. When there are no more
tests to write, then the program is complete. In theory.</p>

<p>The blessing of TDD is that each test is like a public contract: when X is applied, Y shall happen, but
not Z. If a change is made sometime later and the tests still pass, then relief
can be sighed; otherwise, the failed tests right away point out that the recent
change was not appropriate.</p>

<p>The curse of TDD is that it's hard, it takes too much time, quite a few of the
tests are rendered useless over time, and if you start out a project in TDD,
changing direction is rather difficult. <abbr title=" David Heinemeier Hansson">DHH</abbr>
lobbed an anti-TDD bomb in April 2014 with "<a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html">TDD is dead. Long live testing.</a>"</p>

<p>These are all valid points, but as Martin Fowler and Kent Beck also said in
<a href="http://youtu.be/gWD6REVeKW4">Is TDD Dead? [Part V &amp; VI]</a>, TDD forces one to approach
a hard problem one small step at a time; once the hugely difficult problem is
reduced to smaller, easier to understand problems, the difficult bits are easier
to approach and figure out. In the same video above, even DHH says that TDD is
the gateway drug to better practices. Similarly, I have read elsewhere and have
heard from several mentors that TDD is also an important step to take in learning
good programming skills. For instance, learning TDD also forces one to learn and
practice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29"><abbr title="Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, and Dependency inversion">SOLID</abbr> principals</a>.</p>

<p>I will admit that at work, our codebase is not test-driven. Yet, we do utilize
unit tests for core features and try to ensure 100% code coverage for those tests.
This helps us feel better that changes we make to the core code will not break the
code (or at least not as much) as compared to anxiety we would fee if we did not
have tests in place.</p>

<h3>TDD Kata</h3>

<p>Given that Kata help drive difficult movement into muscle memory and that TDD is
beneficial to learning good programming practices, I try to incorporate TDD Kata
into my weekly routine.</p>

<p>I use TDD Kata to help me internalize new skills. My latest TDD kata have helped
me learn to use <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>, <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/">PSR-4</a>, <a href="https://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a>, and basic <accr title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</accr>.</p>

<p>Some interesting TDD Kata to attempt can be found at the <a href="http://cyber-dojo.org/">Cyber Dojo</a>.
In a near-future post, I will attempt to walk through the TDD Fizz Buzz Kata.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br/>

            <link href="/blog/2014/05/06/Lonestar-PHP-Conference-2014"/>
            <updated>2014-05-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2014/05/06/Lonestar-PHP-Conference-2014</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was fortunate to receive a scholarship to attend the 2014 <a href="http://lonestarphp.com/">Lone Star PHP Conference</a> in Addison, TX (Dallas metro area) over the April last weekend in April. I just had to get myself there. Thank you, Lone Star PHP and <a href="http://nomadphp.com/">NomadPHP</a>!</p>

<p>I enjoyed meeting some of the luminaries of the PHP Renaissance, meeting some of the local PHP aficionados, and attending talks. I walked into the conference feeling very much like a n00b and left realizing that I know more than I give myself credit for — I am the very model of a modern major impostor-syndromite.</p>

<p>Some items of particular note:
I attended the inaugural <a href="http://phpbridge.org/">PHPBridge</a> course, provided by <a href="http://phpwomen.org/">PHPWomen</a>, and ended up helping a few PHP-ers getting their dev environments set up with Vagrant and VirtualBox. I met Elizabeth Smith (<a href="https://twitter.com/auroraeosrose">@auroraeosrose</a>), Michelle Sanver (<a href="https:/twitter.com/michellesanver">@michellesanver</a>), Matthew Frost (<a href="https://twitter.com/shrtwhitebldguy">@shrtwhitebldguy</a>), and Davey Shafik (<a href="https://twitter.com/dshafik">@dshafik</a>)— all of whom were leading the all-day course. In the process of taking the course, I forked the lesson in Github and submitted a few pull requests. I also met a few Texas PHP folks whom I continued talking with after class and after the conference. As I mentioned to several of the course coordinators and students, I plan to take PHPBridge to my local PHP User Group.</p>

<p>The first-afternoon’s keynote was by Alison Gianotto (<a href="https://twitter.com/snipeyhead">@snipeyhead</a>) on why web security is important and how to mitigate against security failures. Mind === blown. Snipe is an entertaining speaker and I would have loved to learn more from her.</p>

<p>The after-party was notable in that I met a few PHP luminaries and attended the live-recording of the 3rd “<a href="http://looselycoupled.info/blog/2014/04/30/episode-3-conference-conversations/">Loosely Coupled</a>” podcast. I talked with Adam Culp (<a href="https://twitter.com/adamculp">@adamculp</a>) about extreme marathon running, a topic of which I know nothing, and learned a new respect for the sport. I talked for a while with Cal (<a href="https://twitter.com/CalEvans">@CalEvans</a>) and Kathy Evans (<a href="https://twitter.com/Kateva">@Kateva</a>). I also drank some tasty beers brewed by speaker Omni Adams (<a href="https://twitter.com/omnicolor">@omnicolor</a>. A murder of nerds then headed over to a sushi joint for a late dinner where I sat at a table with Omni, Ben Ramsey(<a href="https://twitter.com/ramsey">@ramsey</a>), the folks behind <a href="http://www.phpdevhired.com/">PHP Dev Hired</a> (Mike (I didn’t catch his last name) and Lonnie Brown(<a href="https://twitter.com/lbrown972">@lbrown972</a>) and someone else whose name I didn’t catch (sorry!); the conversations spanned the gamut from the deep to the sublime. My miso was meh and I was glad that my sushi order never arrived.</p>

<p>The following day, I attended six talks: Dustin Whittle's (<a href="https://twitter.com/dustinwhittle">@dustinwhittle</a>) “<a href="http://symfony.com/video/26/silex-from-micro-to-full-stack/English">Silex: From micro to full-stack</a>,” Ralph Schindler’s (<a href="https://twitter.com/ralphschindler">@ralphschindler</a>) “<a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/lonestarphp/scxrty/">Single Page Apps with AngularJS</a>,” Emma Jane Westby’s (<a href="https://twitter.com/emmajanehw">@emmajanehw</a>) “<a href="http://drupalizeme.github.io/workflow-git-workshop/presentations/slides/session-lonestarphp.html#/">Git for Teams of One or More</a>,” Eli White’s (<a href="https://twitter.com/EliW">@EliW</a>) “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROlhsYQH3qY">Web Security and You</a>,” Justin Carmony’s (<a href="https://twitter.com/JustinCarmony">@JustinCarmony</a>)“<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/justincarmony/top-to-bottom-php-profiling">Top to Bottom PHP Profiling</a>,” and Patrick Mizer’s “<a href="http://www.austintechvideos.com/austinphp/2014/09/21/austinphp-continuous-integration-stop-procrastinating-and-build-often/">Continuous Integration: Stop procrastinating and build often!</a>”</p>

<p>Larry Garfield’s (<a href="https://twitter.com/Crell">@Crell</a>) keynote, “<a href="http://slidedeck.io/Crell/slides-turning-big-ships">Turning Big Ships</a>,” was interesting. He spoke about what one can and should refactor in converting legacy code to something more modern. His example was migrating Drupal from its procedural D7 codebase to the more object-oriented D8. He talked about why one should refactor or re-engineer the small stuff before doing so to the heavy stuff — don’t abandon your userbase; let them get used to the new way before hitting them with the whammy.</p>

<p>The after-party seemed much more relaxed. I talked with Cal and Kathy Evans and Adam Culp some more, had some more of Omni’s homebrew, met a few other folks, and discovered that I stink at playing cornhole.</p>

<p>In all, I had a great time, met some great folks, and was introduced to some new ideas and technologies. I can’t wait to go back!</p>

<p>Last week, I gave a short demo of the <a href="Atom.io">Atom.io</a> text editor to the <a href="http://kcpug.org/">Kansas City PHP User’s Group</a>. I realized after-the-fact that I had presented the early-release as an IDE, when I should have presented it as a fancy text-editor.</p>

<p>Coming from using <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHPStorm</a> as my primary PHP IDE, Atom seems like a cute, yet unintelligent cousin.</p>

<p>I tried to find things to like about it from a PHP point-of-view. After enabling autocomplete and PHP snippets, I could appreciate the Atom.io text editor as just a text editor. Code completion is currently maddening in that it shows absolutely everything ever typed; therefore, it shows nothing of value. The code snippets were more interesting. Creating a foreach loop stub in PHP was as simple as typing <code>foreach &lt;tab&gt;</code>. If I were in a <code>&lt;?php ... ?&gt;</code> segment, I would get a nice foreach loop stub within which to fill in the blanks; yet, if I were in an <code>&lt;html&gt;...&lt;/html&gt;</code> segment, I would get a nice <code>&lt;?php foreach ... ?&gt;</code> stub within which to fill in the blanks. I appreciate that the PHP, JavaScript, and HTML stubbing is container-aware.</p>

<p>From a PHP point-of-view, that was the only positive which I could find for the Atom.io text editor. I made certain to explain that the editor is not yet ready for Prime Time nor are its PHP flavorings fully fleshed out. The editor holds great promise for PHP and code-in-general, but until it can fulfill that promise, I will prefer <a href="http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a> for editing text and PHPStorm for a PHP IDE.</p>

<p>After my largely negative review, I was still able to hand out at least 2 invites.</p>

<p>I look forward to what comes next for Atom.io.</p>

            <title type="html"><![CDATA[Data Types]]></title>
            <link href="/blog/2014/03/10/Data-Types"/>
            <updated>2014-03-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2014/03/10/Data-Types</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I took a programming languages class as part of my degree program in college. In that class, we covered the strongly and weakly classifications of languages as well as the static and dynamic classifications of languages. This was a topic that was barely covered by the textbook, so I did not give it much thought at the time.</p>

<p>Since then, I have given the topic of data types much thought.</p>

<h3>Static vs Dynamic</h3>

<p>Understanding the difference between static and dynamic languages is easy. Static variables are explicitly defined. Dynamic variables are implicitly defined.</p>

<h4>C++ – Static</h4>

<pre><code class="cpp">    String bookTitle; // will only allow strings and will treat its contents
                      // as strings.
    bookTitle = "Great Expectations"; // only allows strings
    bookTitle = 47; // error
</code></pre>

<h4>Dart – Dynamic</h4>

<pre><code class="dart">    /** Technically, Dart is "optionally typed" in that variables can be
    either static, if defined with a specific type, or dynamic, if defined
    without a specific type, as below. */

    var bookTitle; // no idea what this is yet.
    bookTitle = "Great Expectations" // ah, it’s a String!
</code></pre>

<h4>Strong vs Weak</h4>

<p>Definitions are hard to come by for strong and weak typing. Some definitions say that these are defined at run-time or compile-time; but I have not been able to find consensus about which is which. In my research, this appears to change from language to language. In other words, there does not appear to be a formal definition of strong or weak typing. Yet, weakly typed languages appear to be those that allow the mixing of data types that make implicit assumptions regarding the intention of the developer. Strongly typed languages only allow the mixing of data types when they are explicitly cast to the same data type.</p>

<h4>PHP – Weak</h4>

<pre><code class="php">    $num = "4"; // this is an implicitly defined String
                // (dynamic typing in action)
    print( $num + 2 ); // Allowed: 6
</code></pre>

<h4>Java – Strong</h4>

<pre><code class="java">    String num1 = "4";
    int num2 = 2;

    // Not allowed. Throws "Breaking on exception: object of type TypeError"
    print( num1 + num2 );

    // Allowed since num1 is a String and num2 is cast to a String: "42"
    print( num1 + num2.toString());
</code></pre>

<h4>Strong vs. Weak vs. Static vs. Dynamic</h4>

<p>I tend to think of these four types of typing not as discrete definitions but as inclusive adjectives to help describe a language.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>STRONG</th>
    <th>WEAK</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>DYNAMIC</th>
    <td>Dart</td>
    <td>PHP</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>STATIC</th>
    <td>C++, Dart, Java</td>
    <td>C</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>“Strong” and “weak” are loaded terms that can be used as a political cudgel by speakers against what they think of as lesser languages. Yes, PHP is a weakly typed language, but it also has <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.typehinting.php">type-hinting</a> within OOP, which adds some strength to its weak typing system.</p>

<p>Use “strong” and “weak” with a grain of salt. “Dynamic” and “static” are much more useful terms.</p>

            <link href="/blog/2011/10/01/python-timing-comparison"/>
            <updated>2011-10-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2011/10/01/python-timing-comparison</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On page 7 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-Powerful-Object-Oriented-Programming/dp/0596158068/">Learning Python (4th ed)</a>, Mark Lutz briefly discusses the speed differences between Python and compiled languages like C++. I was curious as to how much slower an interpreted language is than a compiled language. To illustrate this, I whipped up a quick and simple program that exercises the CPU so I can see the difference — calculating 2^a-big-number, chosen at runtime, should do the trick. PHP is used in this example as another interpreted language to be compared against.</p>

<p>C++:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
    printf("%lf\n", pow(2,atoi(argv[1])));
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Python 3:</p>

<pre><code class="python">import sys
print(2 ** int(sys.argv[1]))
</code></pre>

<p>PHP 5.3:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php printf('%f', pow(2,$argv[1])); ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The Bash script to rule them all:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">echo 'C++ Compile and Run:'
time { g++ 2powX.cpp -o 2powX; ./2powX $1; }
echo ''
echo 'C++ Run-only:'
time { ./2powX $1; }
echo ''
echo 'Python3:'
time { python3 2powX.py $1; }
echo ''
echo 'PHP 5.3:'
time { php 2powX.php $1; }
</code></pre>

<p>To start the test, I just need to think of a large number (under 1024 to be fair to C++ and PHP):</p>

<pre><code class="bash">./2powX.sh 1023
</code></pre>

<p>(this will calculate 2^1023)</p>

<p>My output:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">C++ Compile and Run:

<p>I am tossing out the “real” time since that can be affected by other processes. “User” and “sys” show time the CPU devoted to running those individual scripts. As such, the times for this one run can now be rewritten as:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">C++ Compile and Run:
User + Sys: 0m0.080s

C++ Run-only:
User + Sys: 0m0.008s

Python:
User + Sys: 0m0.048s

PHP 5.3:
User + Sys: 0m0.033s
</code></pre>

<p>So, as can be seen the limited test above, Python is fairly whippy, but it is much slower than compiled C++ and only slightly slower than PHP. As should be expected, the clear loser is C++ when compiling and running the script.</p>

<p>Where Python shows its strength in this test is when I chose an exponent greater than 1023: 10230.</p>

<p>C++ and PHP return “inf” or “INF”, which means the output was too great for the number type to handle. I could have fixed that by using additional or third-party libraries (ex. “gmp” in <a href="http://gmplib.org/">C++</a> and <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.gmp.php">PHP</a>), but that wouldn’t have been fair for this test. Without having to import any special libraries, Python was itching to output any number-size calculation I wanted to throw at it. If it calculated 2^10230 in 0.068s, how long would it take to calculate 2^10230000? 2m21.530s, but I won’t print the output here since it takes 3,079,537 characters to show.</p>

<p>So what did I learn from this limited test? Python is slower to run than compiled C++ and just a little slower than PHP 5; however, it is also much easier to get the information I need with Python out of the gate without having to include or import additional libraries, third-party or not. Python is definitely a language I will continue to explore.</p>
