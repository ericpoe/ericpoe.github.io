            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently had the opportunity to take my love of programming from being a hobby
to being a career. I jumped at the chance.</p>

<p>I am now in my 3rd week of the new job and have yet to go to work. Instead, I
meet up with fellow nerds and geek out on programming. I have survived my first
agile sprint and resolved two introductory issues with the codebase; one in PHP
(<a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony 2</a> with <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/">Doctrine</a>)
and the other in JavaScript (<a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/">ExtJS</a>).</p>

<p>I have much to learn in my new career and I look forward to every second of it.</p>
