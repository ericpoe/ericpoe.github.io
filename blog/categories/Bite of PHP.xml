            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="heredoc">Heredoc</h3>

<p>Heredoc will define a string of text in a what-you-see-is-what-you-mean type
of format. So, if you want to echo out structured text, like so:</p>

<pre><code class="html">I think that I
    Shall never pay
As much as I
    Have for 2015-04-23
</code></pre>

<p>You would put it in a heredoc like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$today = date('Y-m-d');
$poem = &lt;&lt;&lt;HTML
I think that I
    Shall never pay
As much as I
    Have for $today
HTML;

echo $poem;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>output:</strong></p>

<pre>
I think that I
    Shall never pay
As much as I
    Have for 2015-04-23
</pre>

<p>Notice that heredoc can behave like a template and parse any PHP contained within.</p>

<p>Test it out on <a href="http://3v4l.org/GZl9Z">3v4l.org</a>.</p>

<h3 id="nowdoc">Nowdoc</h3>

<p>Nowdoc will define a string of text in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get type of format. So, if you want to show the above example EXACTLY as written, put it in a nowdoc block.</p>

<pre><code class="php">$today = date('Y-m-d');
$poem = &lt;&lt;&lt;'HTML'
I think that I
    Shall never pay
As much as I
    Have for $today
HTML;

echo $poem;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>output:</strong></p>

<pre>
I think that I
    Shall never pay
As much as I
    Have for $today
</pre>

<p>Test it out on <a href="http://3v4l.org/H1YjU">3v4l.org</a>.</p>

<p>Notice that the only difference between the heredoc block and the nowdoc block is that the nowdoc block's name is enclosed within single-quotes. For me, the single-quotes makes it easy to remember which block is literal and which block is rendered, just like the <a href="/blog/2015/03/04/double-vs-single-quote-echo/">difference between echoing single-quotes and double-quotes</a>.</p>

            <link href="http://ericpoe.com/blog/2015/03/04/double-vs-single-quote-echo"/>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In PHP, we have two ways of formatting an echo statement: we can choose to
use single-quotes or double-quotes. The choice is less dependent upon which
side of the Atlantic we learned to read and more dependent upon what we hope
to accomplish with echoing that string.</p>

<p>If you want to echo the string without parsing it, use single-quotes. If you
want to parse the string while echoing it, use double-quotes. Observe:</p>

<p><strong>Single-Quote Example</strong></p>

<pre><code class="php">$greeting = "Howdy";
$audience = "World";
echo '$greeting, $audience';
</code></pre>

<p><em>Output:</em> <code>$greeting, $audience</code></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Double-Quote Example</strong></p>

<pre><code class="php">$greeting = "Howdy";
$audience = "World";
echo "$greeting, $audience";
</code></pre>

<p><em>Output:</em> <code>Howdy, World</code></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>What if you want to add a character to the output of one of those variables?
Just enclose the variable in a curly bracket!</p>

<p><strong>Special Double-Quote Example</strong></p>

<pre><code class="php">$greeting = "Howdy";
$audience = "World";
echo "$greeting, {$audience}!";
</code></pre>

<p><em>Output:</em> <code>Howdy, World!</code></p>

<p><br></p>
