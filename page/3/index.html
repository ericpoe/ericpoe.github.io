            <h2><a href="http://ericpoe.com/blog/2014/12/28/now-with-sculpin">Now with Sculpin</a></h2>
            <strong>2014-12-28</strong>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I have moved my site from one domain to another. I was using Wordpress on my old
site and was happy. Adding pages was a thing of beauty. Configuring was a dream.
Then I wanted to modify my theme. Then I wanted to use some fun HTML5 tags. Then
I wanted to minimize hacking vectors. Then I realized that I was sacrificing
performance to use a database that I was merely using to dynamically create static
content... why?</p>

<p>If only Wordpress were as performant and easy to theme as the first blog I cobbled
together using static PHP files back in the early aughts. Ah, that first blog
was easy to add funky HTML syntax and add features; but each new page required
editing 3 PHP files so the menu, archive, and each individual page would use the
new content. At one point, I figured out that if I used a common naming structure,
that I could tell the menu to dynamically build by looking at the file structure
 &mdash; thereby reducing the need to edit the menu.php file. Success!</p>

<p>I muddled through with Wordpress (did I mention the constant need to stay on top
of updates and patches for Wordpress and associated plugins?). Then I discovered
<a href="https://sculpin.io">Sculpin</a>.</p>

<p>The immediate benefits to Sculpin that I could see were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Static file generator</li>
<li>Files are created using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, which means I can add funky HTML tags when necessary.</li>
<li>The base project is written in open-source PHP, which means that I can bugfix and extend the source as I see fit.</li>
<li>Theming is done via <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">twig</a> &amp; CSS (currently using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a>)</li>
<li>No performance loss due to dynamically generating a view via database lookups.</li>
<li>Nice community (a huge bonus!)</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, the benefits are that I can utilize it now and benefit, I learn
its components now and I can utilize that knowledge later (CSS, Bootstrap, twig,
HTML5, etc).</p>

<p>As I started to play with Sculpin, I kept thinking back to my original blog and
how close I was back then to what I am now doing. What I was missing then was the
generation of the static HTML files that Sculpin allows.</p>

<h3 id="making-it-work">Making it work</h3>

<p>I spent too much time this weekend trying to figure out how to edit my Sculpin
site locally and yet keep that version-controlled via git as well as keeping my
production code version-controlled via git. Happily, I believe that I have found
a way to do both.</p>

<p>I keep my in-progress code, which includes minor modifications to the <a href="https://github.com/sculpin/sculpin-blog-skeleton">blog
skeleton</a>, in a Bitbucket repo.
I keep my production site, which is generated by Sculpin, in a Github repo, which
is actually what you are reading right now. To keep the two segments segregated,
I am doing the following:</p>

<p>On my dev machine, I have the following directory structure:</p>

<pre>
+-ericpoe\
|
+-+- ericpoe.sculpin\
  |
  +-- ericpoe.github.io\
</pre>

<p>Within my <code>ericpoe.sculpin</code> directory, I keep my sculpin blog skeleton and my Markdown source files. I have two remotes: <code>origin</code>, which points to my draft on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ericpoe/">bitbucket</a>, and <code>sync</code>, which points to the source of the <a href="https://github.com/sculpin/sculpin-blog-skeleton">Sculpin blog skeleton</a>.</p>

<p>Within my <code>ericpoe.github.io</code> directory, I keep the html files generated by the <code>sculpin generate --env=prod</code> command.</p>

<p>Tying it all together, I keep three bash files in my root <code>ericpoe</code> directory:</p>

<p><code>sync.sh</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">#! /bin/bash
cd ericpoe.sculpin
git checkout master
git pull sync master
</code></pre>

<p><code>draft.sh</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">#! /bin/bash
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "usage: ./draft.sh \"commit message\""
    exit 1;
fi

cd ericpoe.sculpin
git checkout master
git add .
git commit -m "$1"
git push -u origin master
</code></pre>

<p><code>publish.sh</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">#! /bin/bash

if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "usage: ./publish.sh \"commit message\""
    exit 1;
fi

cd ericpoe.sculpin
sculpin generate --env=prod

cd ../ericpoe.github.io
git checkout master

cp -R ../ericpoe.sculpin/output_prod/* .

git add .
git commit -m "$1"
git push origin --all
</code></pre>

<p>My workflow now is to:</p>

<ol>
<li>create a new Markdown file with the yaml tuple <code>draft: true</code></li>
<li>create my text</li>
<li>test my text via <code>sculpin generate --watch --server</code></li>
<li>make any changes needed</li>
<li>backup the draft by running <code>draft.sh</code></li>
<li>if I feel ready, remove the yaml tuple <code>draft: true</code></li>
<li>publish to my site, which is hosted by github, by running <code>publish.sh</code></li>
<li>every now and then, when the need strikes, update the core code by running <code>sync.sh</code></li>
</ol>

<p>This simple workflow will allow me to explore other technologies and to concentrate on the topic-at hand while posting about it here.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <h3 id="kata">Kata</h3>

<p>Kata are a series of movements which, when repeated, migrate mindful action into
muscle memory. An example kata is performed by <a href="http://youtu.be/iiiznDpoapQ?t=50s">Rika Usami</a>
of Japan during the 2012 World Karate Championship in Paris.</p>

<p>Kata can be thought of in terms of playing an instrument or a craft. During the
warmup before a concert, listen to the musicians. They are playing their scales
and odd passages, they are practicing their kata to get their brains and fingers
in the right place to pull off something difficult and awesome.</p>

<p><em>Kata, like scales, are temporary in nature. They are to be practiced, then discarded, then practiced again.</em></p>

<p>Programming also requires practice; kata are a great way to formalize that practice.</p>

<h3 id="tdd">TDD</h3>

<p>Test-Driven Development (aka "TDD") is the practice of writing a test before any
other code is written. Write a test that fails, then write the minimum of code to
pass that test, then write another test that fails, etc. When there are no more
tests to write, then the program is complete. In theory.</p>

<p>The blessing of TDD is that each test is like a public contract: when X is applied, Y shall happen, but
not Z. If a change is made sometime later and the tests still pass, then relief
can be sighed; otherwise, the failed tests right away point out that the recent
change was not appropriate.</p>

<p>The curse of TDD is that it's hard, it takes too much time, quite a few of the
tests are rendered useless over time, and if you start out a project in TDD,
changing direction is rather difficult. <abbr title=" David Heinemeier Hansson">DHH</abbr>
lobbed an anti-TDD bomb in April 2014 with "<a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html">TDD is dead. Long live testing.</a>"</p>

<p>These are all valid points, but as Martin Fowler and Kent Beck also said in
<a href="http://youtu.be/gWD6REVeKW4">Is TDD Dead? [Part V &amp; VI]</a>, TDD forces one to approach
a hard problem one small step at a time; once the hugely difficult problem is
reduced to smaller, easier to understand problems, the difficult bits are easier
to approach and figure out. In the same video above, even DHH says that TDD is
the gateway drug to better practices. Similarly, I have read elsewhere and have
heard from several mentors that TDD is also an important step to take in learning
good programming skills. For instance, learning TDD also forces one to learn and
practice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29"><abbr title="Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, and Dependency inversion">SOLID</abbr> principals</a>.</p>

<p>I will admit that at work, our codebase is not test-driven. Yet, we do utilize
unit tests for core features and try to ensure 100% code coverage for those tests.
This helps us feel better that changes we make to the core code will not break the
code (or at least not as much) as compared to anxiety we would fee if we did not
have tests in place.</p>

<h3 id="tdd-kata">TDD Kata</h3>

<p>Given that Kata help drive difficult movement into muscle memory and that TDD is
beneficial to learning good programming practices, I try to incorporate TDD Kata
into my weekly routine.</p>

<p>I use TDD Kata to help me internalize new skills. My latest TDD kata have helped
me learn to use <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>, <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/">PSR-4</a>, <a href="https://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a>, and basic <accr title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</accr>.</p>

<p>Some interesting TDD Kata to attempt can be found at the <a href="http://cyber-dojo.org/">Cyber Dojo</a>.
In a near-future post, I will attempt to walk through the TDD Fizz Buzz Kata.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br/>
Eric</p>

            <strong>2014-08-15</strong>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I was recently talking with a non-programmer friend of mine about teaching our kids how to code. I told him about my long and winding road to loving programming. He told me that he just doesn’t get how anything so tedious as programming can hold anyone’s interest for more than 5 minutes. Visual design, on the other hand, he finds utterly fascinating.</p>

<p>I agreed that design is easier to convey as exciting, that graphic arts is designed to convey a message to people; while programming, by comparison, looks like a bunch of arcane spell casting designed to convey a message to computers.</p>

<p>Then I told him that programs, at their heart, are for people to read and not for computers. Computers understand basic instructions written in ones and zeros to make them happy; while my eyes glaze over when I see a bunch of ones and zeros (as long as they aren’t preceded by a dollar sign).</p>

<p>We write programs for people to read. At some point, a compiler will look at that code and shake its silicon head as it takes the carefully crafted code and interprets it into some kind of gobbledygook that only certain CPUs will understand. But for now, I write programs to do something that the client wants. The client doesn’t care which paradigms I follow, which architecture I use, or even which programming languages I use. As long as the computer does what the client wants, the client is happy. Yet, code does not come out of my brain in one take. Code, like story-telling, comes in multiple attempts and revisions, depending on the mood of my audience and myself.</p>

<p>Ah, who is my audience? At times, my audience is my client; at other times, my audience is myself or my fellow programmer. The difference between a program and code is that a program is written for a client to enjoy while code is written for the human programmer to enjoy and the compiler to interpret into a program.</p>

<p>The code itself is typically made up of words in English and symbols which are translated into English. So,</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var Elvis = new singer();
Elvis-&gt;style("RockNRoll");
</code></pre>

<p>is interpreted as “Elvis is a singer of the RockNRoll style.” I, as the fellow programmer thinks, “Ah, this is interesting, what happens to Elvis?” I find out within this coded function that the Elvis variable goes through several transformations and influences several different variables. Wait, what’s this, the Elvis variable, when combined with the Priscilla variable, generates a LisaMarie variable? What’s the story behind this Priscilla variable? What happens to this LisaMarie variable? Yet, the client is completely unaware of the existence of the variables Elvis, Priscilla, and LisaMarie. The only thing the client is aware of from this internal interaction, is that the movie “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Naked_Gun:_From_the_Files_of_Police_Squad!">Naked Gun</a>” had some rock music in it.</p>

<p>So, coding is telling a story and programming is interpreting that story into another story. Just as Shakespeare wrote his plays for actors to read and interpret and those actors then compiled his stories into dramatizations for the audience to enjoy.</p>

<p>I once saw  “Macbeth” in the late 80s presented as as Sandinistas vs. Contras in Nicaragua. Was this Shakespeare’s intent? No, yet his intent was interpreted by the actors and presented in a manner unlike how it would have been interpreted and presented nearly 400 years prior.</p>

<p>Dostoevsky winnowed all of literature down to one of two stories: a stranger comes to town or someone goes on a journey. In programming, all functions can be boiled down to information comes in or information goes out. In both literature and programming, sometimes it’s a combination of the two truths.</p>

<p>Sometimes, my object goes on a great journey. Sometimes, interesting things happen to it. It’s all in the way we tell the story.</p>
